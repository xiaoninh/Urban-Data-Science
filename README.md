# PUI2018_xh1163

This is the folder for HW1 of the PUI class. 

During HW1, I am responsible to create an Environmental variable "PUI2018" that points to the PUI2018 directory I created, and also create an alias "pui2018" as a shortcut of comment that takes to that directory when called. 

While setting the enviromental variable and alias, I also need to make sure that they are permanently saved in the bash_profile and can be used for later. 

The follorwing screenshots are the bash_profile file where one can see the alias and enviromental variable I created, and a screenshot of my terminal that shows this series of commands and their output to show that the enviromental variable and alias actually exsit and work well.

I added a percentage plot in addition to the absolute counts to more clearly compare the relative ridership between two age groups.
I also edited the titles and labels of the plots based on the feedback, and I described the plots in more details.
I didn't change the side-by-side bar to a stacked bar, however, because the stacked bar is confusing to me and I personally prefer the side-by-side bar since it can show the differences in a straightforward way.
